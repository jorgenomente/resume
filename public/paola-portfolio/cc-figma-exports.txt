Files exported from Figma (placeholder):
- avatar.svg (simple placeholder avatar with initials)
- hero-bg.svg (background gradients)
- pp-logo.svg (wordmark)

Replace these with full Figma exports if you want exact assets: colors, icons, and photos. I added them to public/paola-portfolio/ for the page to use.
